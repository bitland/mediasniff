MediaSniff: multi-media capturing tool
======================================

current state: broken

This idea came while trying various YouTube(tm) capturing tool. Instead of using a proxy
or an ads-ridden product, why not just listen on network connections for media content ?

The current incentation uses node-pcap (which does all the hard work) to decode the http
requests. Media type is simply determined by reading the returned content-type (which works
in most cases).

Please note: this tool is not polished, I did it for my personal usage. Feel free to use it
and send me some patches !
